## <a name="about"></a>About This Project

About this project:

- This project was created to make information about myself available to an audience interested in me.
- The project uses git pages to share live content. Because of the use of this technology, the application does not connect to the api and instead uses local json data to generate content.
- The site is being updated over time with new content and visual changes.
